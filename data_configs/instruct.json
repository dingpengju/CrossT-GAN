    "MSL": "Derived from NASA Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover, it records sensor and actuator data from the rover on the surface of Mars. The dataset contains 27 entities (e.g., powertrain, navigation module), 55 metrics per entity, and 58,317 and 73,729 observations for the training and test sets, respectively, with an anomaly ratio of 10.72%. Due to the diversity of tasks performed by the rover (e.g., rock sampling, mobile navigation), the data show a high degree of non-periodicity and environmental dependence. Related studies have pointed out that some of its anomalies (e.g., battery plunge, robotic arm jamming) need to be analyzed in conjunction with joint multi-sensor analysis, while simple thresholding methods are prone to miss detection. The dataset is used to validate the algorithm's ability to generalize under extreme environments (e.g., radiation interference, sandstorms), and only non-trivial sequences (A4, C2, T1) are retained to exclude easily identifiable noise.",
   
    "SMAP": "Acquired by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite, it is primarily used to monitor Earth's soil moisture and environmental parameters. The dataset contains 55 entities (satellite subsystems or sensors), each recording 25 telemetry metrics such as radiation, temperature, power, and computational activity. The data are collected at a minute frequency, with the training set containing 135,183 observations and the test set containing 427,617 observations with an anomaly share of about 13.13%. This dataset is widely used in spacecraft anomaly detection studies, and its core challenge is to deal with highly non-stationary time-series data and complex environmental noise. Particular attention is paid to anomaly patterns triggered by sensor drift, extreme weather or hardware failures.",

    "SMD": "Collected from 28 server clusters of a large Internet company, recording 38 resource metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, network traffic, etc., and covering five weeks of operational data. The training and test sets contain 708,405 and 708,420 observations each, with an anomaly ratio of 4.16%, covering hardware failure (disk I/O blocking), software bottleneck (service timeout) and network attack (DDoS traffic) scenarios. The data is characterized by multi-dimensional weak correlation (e.g., CPU and network traffic may be asynchronous anomalies) and transient bursty patterns (e.g., log spikes). This dataset advances research on unsupervised anomaly detection in O&M scenarios.",

    "SWaT": "The collection is taken from a real industrial water treatment system and simulates the physical-information fusion control process of a modern water plant. The system contains 6 treatment stages (e.g., ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis), each controlled by an independent PLC involving 38 sensors and actuators (e.g., pumps, valves) for water level, flow rate, and chemical dosage. The dataset contains 7 days of normal operation and 4 days of anomalous operation data injected with cyber-attacks, totaling about a million observations. Its application focuses on industrial control system (ICS) security research, e.g., detecting covert attacks against sensor data tampering or actuator command hijacking. The high dimensionality of the data, the strong temporal dependency and the physical cascading effects of the attacks (e.g., tank overflows) make it an important benchmark for evaluating the robustness of anomaly detection algorithms."
